\title{Prepare Data for Associative Classification}
\usage{
prepareTransactions(formula, data, disc.method = "mdlp", match = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{the formula.}

\item{data}{a data.frame with the data.}

\item{disc.method}{Discretization method used to discretize continuous
variables if data is a data.frame (default: \code{"mdlp"}). See
\code{\link[=discretizeDF.supervised]{discretizeDF.supervised()}} for more supervised discretization
methods.}

\item{match}{typically \code{NULL}. Only used internally if data is a
already a set of transactions.}
}
\value{
An object of class \link[arules:transactions-class]{arules::transactions} from
\pkg{arules} with an attribute called \code{"disc_info"} that contains
information on the used discretization for each column.
}
\description{
Converts data.frame into transactions suitable for classification based on association rules.
}
\details{
To convert a data.frame into items in a transaction dataset for classification,
the following steps are performed:
\enumerate{
\item All continuous features are discretized using class-based
discretization (default is MDLP) and each range is represented as an item.
\item Factors are converted into items, one item for each level.
\item Each logical is converted into an item.
\item If the class variable is a logical, then a negative class item is added.
}

Steps 1-3 are skipped if \code{data} is already as \link[arules:transactions-class]{arules::transactions} object.
}
\examples{
# Perform discretization and convert to transactions
data("iris")
iris_trans <- prepareTransactions(Species ~ ., iris)
inspect(head(iris_trans))

# A negative class item is added for regular transaction data (here "!canned beer")
# Note: backticks are needed in formulas with item labels that contain a space or special
# character.
data("Groceries")
g2 <- prepareTransactions(`canned beer` ~ ., Groceries)
inspect(head(g2))
